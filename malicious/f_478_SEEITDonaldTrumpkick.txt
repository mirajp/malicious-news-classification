What a baby.

Donald Trump booted a fussy baby from a rally Tuesday because the tot was wailing over the businessman's speech.

"You can get the baby out of here," the GOP presidential nominee barked from the stage in Ashburn, Va.

The baby banishment came just seconds after Trump bragged about his love of children and promised that the crying kid could stay.

"Don't worry about that baby. I love babies," Trump said as the tot's wailed interrupted a speech about trade imbalance, according to Politico. "Don't worry about it. I love babies. I hear that baby crying, I like it. What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don't worry, don't worry. The mom's running around like--don't worry about it, you know. It's young and beautiful and healthy and that's what we want."

But when the infant kept crying, Trump changed his tune.

"Actually, I was only kidding, you can get the baby out of here," the Republican nominee said, hinting that his previously professed love for babies was just sarcasm.

"That's all right. Don't worry. I -- I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking," he said as the crowd cheered and laughed. "That's OK. People don't understand. That's OK."
