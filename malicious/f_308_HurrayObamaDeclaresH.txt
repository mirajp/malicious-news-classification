PRESIDENT Obama has admitted for the first time, that he and his family are "seriously considering" moving to Canada if Donald Trump is elected the 46th president of the United States. The news comes after Obama launched a scathing attack on Trump, calling him"woefully unprepared" and "unfit to be president". The current U.S. president was speaking to the White House press corps when he expressed his "deep disappointment" with the republican party's nominee, leading him and the First Lady to explore other options. "It's something Michelle, the kids and I have discussed as a potential solution to the Donald," he said. "I have also spoken with Prime Minister Trudeau who outlined Canada's generous immigration policy for wealthy individuals, so we'll see."
