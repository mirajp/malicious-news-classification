NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)--The Republican Presidential nominee, Donald Trump, tore into the media on Thursday for what he called its "extremely unfair practice" of reporting the things he says.

"I'll say something at a rally and I look out and see all these TV cameras taking every word down," Trump told Fox News's Sean Hannity. "No one in politics has ever been subjected to this kind of treatment."

"It's unbelievable and, frankly, very unethical," he added.

At a rally in Florida, the candidate lashed out at a TV cameraman whom he caught in the act of recording his words for broadcasting purposes.

"Look at him over there, picking up everything I'm saying, folks," Trump shouted. "Get him out of here."

In his interview with Fox, Trump hinted that he might drop out of this fall's televised Presidential debates if the media continues its practice of reporting the things he says.

"I've always said that I would be willing to debate if I'm treated fairly," Trump told Hannity. "But if the media keeps recording everything I say, word for word, and then playing it back so that everyone in the country hears exactly what I said, I would consider that very, very unfair."
