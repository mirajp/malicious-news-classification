People are rotting in prison for doing a FRACTION of what Hillary has done with our nation's secrets.

Folks, she had her MAID printing off piles of classified emails.

Her server, which she kept in some bathroom closet, was HACKED by at least FIVE by foreign players.

Just because she's rich and powerful and has a rigged system saying "She's INNOCENT" doesn't make it so.

Right now there are GOOD Americans rotting away in prison for doing the smallest fraction of what Hillary did.

She's getting away with TREASON.

Those were the exact words expressed from the Chairman of Homeland Security said.

Michael McCaul was among the first to call Hillary's choice to carelessly have a personal server which she used for State Department business a treasonous act. Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, on Thursday said Hillary Clinton's exposing sensitive information to potentially multiple hacks from foreign actors amounts to treason. "This is why you have security protocols -- to protect classified information," Mr. McCaul said on "Fox and Friends." "She exposed it to our enemies, and now ... our adversaries have this very sensitive information that not only jeopardizes her and national security at home, but the men and women serving overseas." "In my opinion, quite frankly, it's treason," said Mr. McCaul, Texas Republican.

This needs to end.

Our system is rotten to the core.

The ONLY way to fix it, is to vote for Trump and #DrainTheSwamp.
