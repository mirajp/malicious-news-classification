Word On Da Street

Controversial televangelist and pastor Creflo Dollar recently announced that he had received a divine message from God himself telling him to endorse Trump and that God actually apologized to him for the "mixed messages he was sending". You cannot make this stuff up folks...SMH. Check out the details below...

"God came to me in a dream last night and said that Trump is his chosen candidate," Dollar said. "God apologized for the mixed messages he was sending. I now know that Trump has been touched by the hand of God."

Creflo even went on to compare Trump to John the Baptist...

"Trump is like John the Baptist, sent to prepare the world for the return of our Lord, Jesus Christ."

SMH....wow. I still can't believe that this guy still has a congregation. First of all, why would God have to apologize? Is he trying to say that God makes mistakes? And who the hell, no pun intended, is Creflo that God would have to apologize to him?! I'm sure the check that he received from Donald Trump's campaign inspired this "dream" and all the gullible people who actually believe and follow Creflo need to be allowed to park in handicapped spots. The only thing worse than the devil himself are those that use God's name to do the devil's work.
