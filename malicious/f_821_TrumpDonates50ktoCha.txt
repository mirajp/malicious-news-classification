"Dylann doesn't deserve to be beaten. Nobody deserves to be beaten. Not even a Mexican."

Tweeted Trump after donating $50,000 to Dylann Roof's family.





Donald Trump donated $50,000 to Dylann Roof's family after he was attacked by an inmate so that he could afford to move to a safer prison while he awaits his trial.



"He could've easily tripped and fell on that trigger and let off 50 rounds by accident. It can happen." - Trump

Trump says don't worry he made that $50,000 back within the next hour due to his multiple investments in foreign hair pieces.
