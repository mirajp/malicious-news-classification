Donald Trump showed Tuesday that he's not a typical baby-kissing politician.

A baby started crying at his campaign rally in Ashburn, Va., and Trump at first shrugged off the interruption.

"Don't worry about that baby, I love babies . . . I hear that baby crying. I like it. What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don't worry, don't worry," he said.

"The mom's running around like -- don't worry about it, you know. It's young and beautiful and healthy, and that's what we want."

He then returned to his remarks about how China has "ripped us to shreds" -- but then the baby started wailing again.

At that point, an annoyed Trump turned toward the mom and said, "Actually, I was only kidding. You can get the baby out of here . . . I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking."

Trump also revealed he plans to spend $100 million of his own money in his effort to become president.

"I put up a lot of money to fund my own campaign," he said. "I think I'm into this for over $60 million now . . . I'll probably be in for $100 million by the time I finish. Think of it, $100 million cash . . . and no tax deduction."

At the start of the event, a man identified as Lt. Col. Louis Dorfman gave Trump a Purple Heart -- a US military decoration awarded to those who are wounded or killed while serving.

"I always wanted to get the Purple Heart," Trump said. "This was much easier, but I tell you it was such an honor."

Records show Dorfman received the award after being wounded in Iraq in 2007.

The Military Order of the Purple Heart issued a statement criticizing Trump's comments.

"Trump did not get the Purple Heart, and there's no 'easy way' to get it," the group said.
